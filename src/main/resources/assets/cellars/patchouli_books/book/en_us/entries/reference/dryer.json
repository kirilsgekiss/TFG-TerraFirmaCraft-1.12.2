So in order to balance when this technology is access-able, a redstone signal is required to power the dryers pump. $(br2) This redstone signal is also utilized to control how hard the dryer works every tick it pumps, a strength of 15 means it will work at full tilt."

There are also two buttons which need to be toggled in order to start the machine, the first that must be pushed will seal the chamber.
